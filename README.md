In the dynamic landscape of modern businesses, the departure of employees, known as attrition, presents both challenges and opportunities for organizations. The reasons behind employee attrition are diverse, ranging from tangible factors like unsatisfactory pay and poor workplace conditions to intangible ones such as personal circumstances like illness, loss, and relocation. Understanding and mitigating attrition is a critical endeavor for companies striving to cultivate a motivated, productive, and cohesive workforce.

In my ambitious undertaking, I delve into the realm of human resources analytics to explore the multifaceted nature of employee attrition. Leveraging the rich and comprehensive IBM data, I embarked on a transformative journey of insight discovery and prediction. My aim is twofold: first, to gain a profound understanding of the underlying factors that contribute to attrition within organizations, and second, to develop a powerful predictive model capable of forecasting attrition patterns with remarkable accuracy.
